# RomRaider

RomRaider is a free, open source tuning suite created for viewing, logging and
tuning of modern Subaru Engine Control Units. The intuitive tuning interface
and powerful datalogger are modelled to be familiar to experienced professional
tuners while providing all the power of expensive commercial products, without
license fees.
